# Document-pdf-analyzer
This project extracts and processes text and tables from PDF and DOCX files. It cleans and analyzes word frequencies, generates the top 20 most common words, and exports them as a CSV. Extracted tables are saved into Excel with separate sheets. Output files are stored in an organized output folder
